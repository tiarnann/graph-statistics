Description: 
    A library which provides functions to achieve the following information about undirected network graphs:
	- Extract cycle counts from directed network graphs
	- Extract a list of node ids within each cycle of the graph
	- Calculate total edge weight for each cycle in the graph
	- Calculate minimum edge weight for each cycle in the graph
	- Assess overlapping of cycles in the network
	- Identify the three most important (most common) nodes
